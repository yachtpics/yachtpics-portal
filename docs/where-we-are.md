# Where we are — September 6, 2026 (evening)

A handoff note, written so a fresh session can pick up mid-stream. Charlie is
shooting in Grenada Sept 6–9. He asked for a deep-dive on "the next big
thing" (see `docs/next-big-thing.md`), read it, and said build all of it —
so this session did. Everything below is **committed but not pushed.**

## The two things that matter right now

**1. Push.** From `C:\Users\charl\yachtpics-portal`:

```
git push
```

Vercel builds in a minute or two. Nobody else can run it — it needs his
GitHub login. (If git complains about a lock file, delete
`.git\index.lock` first — the cloud session couldn't remove it.) The
`_to_delete/` folder at the repo root holds two stale lock files this session
moved out of `.git`; it can be deleted.

**2. Add one environment variable in Vercel** so the AI features switch on:
Vercel → yachtpics-portal → Settings → Environment Variables →
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = a key from console.anthropic.com → redeploy. Without it
the portal behaves exactly as before (the filename guess, the category
prompt, no Draft button). `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` is optional (defaults to
`claude-haiku-4-5`).

## What shipped today (all five items from the deep-dive)

**Listing Reel** — `Reel` button next to Social Post on every listing.
Turns the photos (slideshow order, cover first) into a 9:16 reel (~28s, up to
10 photos) or a 16:9 film (~54s, up to 14). Title card with vessel name /
builder / length / staterooms / price / location (price and location can be
switched off), slow push-in or "whole photo on a soft backdrop", broker end
card with logo and contact, quiet YachtPics credit. Renders **in the
browser** with WebCodecs via the `mediabunny` package (new dependency) —
no server, no render service, no per-video cost. Silent by design (add
trending audio in Instagram). The film can be added to the listing as a
video in one click ("— The Film"), which puts it in the slideshow and Send to
Client. Watermarked for lapsed plans. Needs Chrome/Edge/Safari; Firefox 130+.
Files: `src/app/dashboard/listings/[id]/reel/page.tsx`, `src/lib/canvasText.ts`.

**Listing Intelligence** —
- Send to Client now has a Client Name field and every send gets a token;
  the slideshow link in the email is `?src=send&t=<token>`. Opens are
  attributed by name: push + email say "Mark opened your slideshow" and Sent
  History shows exact open counts (`client_sends.token/client_name/
  open_count/last_opened_at`). Sends before Sept 7 keep the old "gallery
  viewed since" wording, honestly.
- The public slideshow records per-photo dwell (≥1.5s), a heart to save
  photos (kept in the viewer's browser), video plays, 360° tour clicks,
  Details opens, and a per-session summary (seconds on page, photos seen).
  New table `slideshow_events`; new columns on `slideshow_views`. Route:
  `/api/slideshow/event`. Anonymous — random per-tab session id, no cookies.
- **Engagement panel** on the listing page (views, unique visitors, time per
  visit, saved photos, 30-day bars, "what buyers linger on" with thumbnails,
  where views come from). `src/components/ListingEngagement.tsx`,
  `src/lib/engagement.ts`, `/api/listings/[id]/engagement`.
- **Seller Report** at `/report/listing/[id]` — one letter page, broker
  branded, print / save as PDF, forward to the owner.

**AI at upload** (only when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set) —
- Photos the filename can't place are labelled by a vision model right after
  upload (the category prompt is skipped). "Label photos" button relabels
  anything still Other; when nothing is Other it becomes "Re-label photos"
  (everything not set by hand). Hand-set categories are never overwritten
  (`photos.category_source` = manual / filename / ai).
  `src/lib/ai.ts`, `/api/photos/categorize`.
- "Draft with AI" on Edit Listing writes a description from specs + six
  photos in the portal's register; lands in the textarea, saved only when the
  broker saves. `/api/listings/[id]/describe`.

**360° tour + deck plan** — `listings.tour_url`, `listings.deck_plan_path`.
Edit Listing has a new section. Slideshow shows a "360° Tour" tab-button and
the deck plan under Details. Tour link is validated server-side (http/https).

**Listing readiness** — the strip under the listing title: 9 checks (12+
photos, cover, labels, 5 core specs, description, published, video, tour,
docs), each unmet one a link to where it gets fixed.
`src/components/ListingReadiness.tsx`.

Help page updated for all of the above. User-guide PDF **not** regenerated.

## Database

Migration applied live on Sept 6 via the Supabase MCP (additive only) and
saved as `supabase/migrations/20260906_listing_intelligence_reel_tour_ai.sql`.

## What to check after the push

1. Open any listing → **Reel** → Make the reel. Expect a progress bar, then
   a playable video. Download it; it should play on a phone. Try Film, then
   "Add film to this listing" → it appears in the Videos section.
2. Send to Client with a name → open the link from the email → the broker
   gets "Name opened your slideshow" and Sent History shows "opened it 1 time".
3. In the slideshow: heart a photo, sit on a few, open Details. Back on the
   listing, the Engagement panel fills in within a minute (flushes every 8s).
4. Engagement → Seller Report → prints to one page.
5. After adding the key: upload an `IMG_1234.jpg` — it should get a real
   category on its own. Edit Listing → Draft with AI.

## Open threads (carried forward)

- **Natural 9 video needs its line** — listing
  `576a46c9-3809-41c3-a5cd-c0ae5281a206`, video
  `036be9af-ed02-4b5e-9f78-a6380a3c9c37`. Suggested: **"Natural 9 — The
  Film"** / *Interiors, exteriors, and aerials of this 2009 Sunseeker 121,
  start to finish.*
- **Joe Yeni (joe@yenimarine.com)** — warmest subscription prospect;
  downloads are always free, the subscription is for the tools (and now the
  Reel and the Seller Report are two more reasons).
- Video cleanup cron activates Sept 7; a scheduled task on **Sept 8** checks
  it freed ~27 GB.
- Parked: site-photos bucket to Cloudflare; boat-page SEO; Brian Nopper site;
  the closing-gift feature (GROWTH_IDEAS §7) — the moat, next in line.

## Habits worth keeping

- Verify against the real thing before declaring victory. This session could
  only typecheck and lint (no browser, no `next build` — the Linux VM has the
  Windows swc binary); the checks above are the real test.
- When something fails, say the actual reason.
- Copy before delete, verify bytes, and put a gap between the two.
